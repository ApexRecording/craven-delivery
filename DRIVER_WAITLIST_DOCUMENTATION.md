# üöó Crave'N Driver Waitlist System

## Overview

The Driver Waitlist System allows Crave'N to collect verified driver applications **before** launching in a market, while controlling costs by delaying background checks until routes are actually ready. Drivers complete a full, professional onboarding experience thinking they'll start immediately - only after submission do they learn they're on a waitlist.

---

## Key Benefits

### For Crave'N:
- **Cost Savings**: Save $30-40 per driver by deferring background checks until activation
- **Geographic Control**: Launch city-by-city with pre-vetted driver pools
- **Sales Leverage**: "We have 1,200 drivers ready in your area" when pitching restaurants
- **Quality Control**: Full application filters out casual browsers
- **Scalability**: Can handle 10,000+ waitlisted drivers without cost increase

### For Drivers:
- **Professional Experience**: Full onboarding feels legitimate and serious
- **Clear Expectations**: After submission, they understand the wait
- **Sunk Cost Effect**: Completing full application increases commitment
- **Excitement**: Waitlist feels exclusive, not rejected

---

## How It Works

### 1. Driver Applies (Full Experience)

**Landing Page (`/feeder`):**
- Hero copy: "Start Earning Today" (no mention of waitlist)
- CTA: "Apply to Become a Feeder"
- **No indication** this is a waitlist signup

**Application Wizard (6 Steps):**
1. Account Setup (email, password, name, phone)
2. Address (street, city, state, ZIP)
3. Vehicle & License (type, make, model, license details)
4. Background Check Authorization (last 4 of SSN, banking info)
5. Documents Upload (driver's license, insurance, registration photos)
6. Review & Submit

**Experience:** Feels like immediate onboarding, not a lottery entry

---

### 2. Waitlist Reveal (After Submission)

**What Happens Backend:**
```typescript
// Status set to 'waitlist' instead of 'under_review'
status: 'waitlist'
waitlist_joined_at: NOW()
waitlist_position: auto-calculated (by city/state)
background_check: false
background_check_initiated_at: null  // ‚Üê NO COST YET
```

**Full-Screen Success Modal Appears:**
```
You're on the List! üéâ
Thanks for applying, John!

Your application has been received and you've been placed on 
our driver waitlist for Toledo, OH.

What happens next:

‚è≥ When routes open in Toledo, we'll send you an invitation to

- See waitlist positions and geographic heatmap

**Activation Campaign Flow:**
1. Admin selects city (e.g., "Toledo, OH")

3. Admin filters (e.g., "Only car drivers, top 50 positions")
4. Admin clicks "Send Activation Invites"
5. Confirmation: "You're about to invite 47 drivers. This will cost ~$1,640 in background checks. Continue?"

**Activation Email Sent:**
```

### 4. Driver Activation Page

**Route:** `/driver/activate/:token`

**What Driver Sees:**
```
Welcome Back, John! üéâ

You're one step away from delivering with Crave'N in Toledo.

We already have your basic info. Just complete these final steps:
```

**3 Final Steps:**
1. **Confirm Password** (if new user, already exists)
2. **Verify Vehicle Details** (pre-filled, editable)
3. **Background Check Authorization** (full SSN, authorize check)

**On Submit:**
- Updates `status` from `'waitlist'` ‚Üí `'under_review'`
- Stores full SSN (encrypted)
- Sets `background_check_initiated_at: NOW()`
- Triggers actual background check API call ($30-40 charged)
- Creates `driver_profiles` record (status: 'offline')
- Sends "Background Check Initiated" email

---

### 5. Background Check Results

**If Passed:**
- `status` ‚Üí `'approved'`
- `background_check` ‚Üí `true`
- `driver_profiles.status` ‚Üí `'offline'` (ready to go online)

**If Failed:**
- `status` ‚Üí `'rejected'`
- Email: "Update on Your Crave'N Driver Application" (with dispute info)

---

## Database Schema

### New Columns Added to `craver_applications`:

```sql
-- Waitlist tracking
waitlist_joined_at: timestamptz
waitlist_position: integer (auto-calculated)
waitlist_priority_score: integer DEFAULT 0 (for referrals/VIP)
waitlist_notes: text (admin use)

-- Status now includes 'waitlist'
status: 'pending' | 'under_review' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'waitlist' | 'invited'
```

### Auto-Calculate Waitlist Position:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION calculate_waitlist_position()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.status = 'waitlist' THEN
    NEW.waitlist_position := (
      SELECT COUNT(*) + 1
      FROM craver_applications
      WHERE status = 'waitlist'
      AND city = NEW.city
      AND state = NEW.state
      AND created_at < NEW.created_at
    );
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER set_waitlist_position
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON craver_applications
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (NEW.status = 'waitlist')
EXECUTE FUNCTION calculate_waitlist_position();
```

---

## Cost Comparison

### Scenario: 1,000 drivers apply in Month 1

**Old System (Immediate Background Checks):**
- 1,000 background checks √ó $35 = **$35,000**
- But only 100 drivers actually needed ‚Üí **$31,500 wasted**

**New System (Waitlist):**
- 1,000 applications ‚Üí **$0 cost** (just database storage)
- Activate 100 drivers when needed ‚Üí **$3,500**
- **Savings: $31,500** üí∞

**Bonus:**
- 900 drivers still on waitlist = future supply ready to activate (no recruitment needed)

## Success Metrics (After 90 Days)

### Acquisition:
- **500+ drivers on waitlist**
- **60%+ form completion rate** (start ‚Üí submit)
- **80%+ email open rate** (waitlist confirmation)

### Activation:
- **40%+ invitation ‚Üí background check conversion**
- **75%+ background check pass rate**
- **80%+ activated drivers go online within 7 days**

### Engagement:
- **25%+ referral participation** (future feature)
- **<5% waitlist removal requests**
- **4+ driver app logins per week** (once activated)

### Business Impact:
- **Launch new city with 15+ drivers in 2 weeks**
- **30% lower CAC** vs traditional driver recruitment
- **Restaurant pitch success rate +50%** ("we have drivers ready")

---

## Referral System (Future Feature)

### How It Works:
1. After joining waitlist, driver gets unique referral link:
   - Format: `craven.com/drive?ref=TORR123ABC`
2. When someone signs up using referral link:
   - Referee saves `referred_by` in database
   - Referrer gets +10 `priority_score` (moves up waitlist)
   - Referrer gets email: "Thanks for referring John! You moved up 5 spots."
3. Admin sees referral leaderboard
4. Top referrers get priority invitations
5. Bonus: "Refer 5 drivers, skip the line entirely"

### Database Table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE driver_referrals (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  referrer_id uuid REFERENCES craver_applications,
  referee_id uuid REFERENCES craver_applications,
  referral_code text INDEXED,
  status 'pending' | 'completed' | 'activated',
  created_at timestamptz,
  activated_at timestamptz
);
```

**Referral Bonuses:**
- Referrer gets $25 bonus after referee completes 10 deliveries

---

## Security & Compliance

### Data Storage:
- **Waitlist drivers**: Only last 4 of SSN stored (encrypted)
- **Activated drivers**: Full SSN stored (Supabase Vault encryption)
- **Documents**: Private Supabase bucket (`craver-documents`), not publicly accessible
- **Banking info**: Encrypted at rest

### RLS Policies:
```sql
-- Only admins can view waitlist
CREATE POLICY "Admins view waitlist"
ON craver_applications FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Drivers can view their own waitlist status
CREATE POLICY "Drivers view own status"
ON craver_applications FOR SELECT
USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### Email Verification:
- All waitlist emails sent via Resend API
- Rate limiting on signup form (prevent spam)
- Email verification before activation

### Legal Compliance:
- **FCRA Compliance**: Background check authorization collected
- **GDPR**: Right to be forgotten ("Remove me from waitlist" link)
- **CCPA**: Data access requests supported
- **Transparent**: Waitlist revealed immediately after application

---

## Edge Cases & Handling

1. **Duplicate Signups**: Check email uniqueness, show "You're already on the waitlist"
2. **Invalid Documents**: Admin can request resubmit, driver gets email to re-upload
3. **Driver Moves Cities**: Allow drivers to update ZIP code in status page
4. **Expired Invitations**: Auto-revert from `'invited'` ‚Üí `'waiting'` after 14 days
5. **Driver Loses Interest**: "Remove me from waitlist" link in all emails
6. **Background Check Fails**: Clear communication + dispute option
7. **Driver Never Goes Online**: Track "activated but inactive", send reminder emails

---

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created:
1. **`WaitlistSuccessModal.tsx`**: Full-screen modal shown after application submission
2. **Updated `DriverApplicationWizard.tsx`**: Modified to show modal instead of toast
3. **Updated `ApplicationService.ts`**: Changed `submitApplication()` to set `status: 'waitlist'`
4. **Edge Function**: `send-driver-waitlist-email` (Resend API integration)

### Database Migration:
```sql
-- Add waitlist columns
ALTER TABLE craver_applications 
ADD COLUMN waitlist_joined_at timestamptz,
ADD COLUMN waitlist_position integer,
ADD COLUMN waitlist_priority_score integer DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN waitlist_notes text;

-- Create auto-position function
CREATE FUNCTION calculate_waitlist_position() ...
CREATE TRIGGER set_waitlist_position ...
```

### Edge Function Deployment:
- Located: `supabase/functions/send-driver-waitlist-email/index.ts`
- Uses Resend API key (already configured in secrets)
- Auto-deployed on next build

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2:
- **Admin Waitlist Dashboard**: Full UI for managing waitlist
- **Activation Campaigns**: Batch-invite drivers by city
- **Geographic Zones**: Define launch zones with target driver counts
- **Referral System**: Drivers earn priority by referring others

### Phase 3:
- **Driver-Facing Status Page**: `/driver/waitlist-status/:email`
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Conversion funnels, time metrics
- **SMS Notifications**: Supplement email with text alerts
- **Automated Scheduling**: Auto-send activations based on restaurant signups

---

## Conclusion

The Driver Waitlist System transforms driver acquisition from a reactive process ("hire drivers after restaurants sign up") to a proactive asset ("we already have drivers, let's sign restaurants"). 

The key insight: **Make drivers feel like they're joining something exclusive, not just filling out a form.** The waitlist creates FOMO (fear of missing out) and urgency, which is exactly what Crave'N needs to build momentum before official launch.

The admin controls ensure Crave'N never over-promises to drivers or under-delivers on driver availability to restaurants. It's a controlled, professional rollout system disguised as a standard application.

**Estimated ROI:** Save $20,000-30,000 in unnecessary background checks in first 90 days while building a 1,000+ driver pipeline.

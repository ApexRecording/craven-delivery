# 📱 iOS PWA Push Notifications Setup Guide

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Complete iOS PWA push notification support with:
- VAPID keys generated
- Web Push Protocol implementation
- iOS-specific permission handling
- PWA detection and requirements checking
- Test notification functionality

## 🔑 VAPID Keys Generated

**Public Key:** (Already added to frontend)

```

**Private Key:** (Must be added to Supabase)
```

```

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### 1. Add VAPID Private Key to Supabase

#### Via Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Edge Functions** → **Secrets**
4. Add these environment variables:

```
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=BPgLUmyCVcWgjxTTQiwY0FSiD7pm-X5u6z7OCU1sXpypwvrrXXja_ADXlEVVGkoisV2XdFpoNMMS_yKFp2FpIC8

VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=JL_Ehq0Pis03yIXGt2Ml1jt8-kCRumaJzAViaGbMEmA

VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:support@craven.app
```

#### Via Supabase CLI:
```bash
# Set the secrets
supabase secrets set VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=BPgLUmyCVcWgjxTTQiwY0FSiD7pm-X5u6z7OCU1sXpypwvrrXXja_ADXlEVVGkoisV2XdFpoNMMS_yKFp2FpIC8

supabase secrets set VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=JL_Ehq0Pis03yIXGt2Ml1jt8-kCRumaJzAViaGbMEmA

supabase secrets set VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:support@craven.app
```

### 2. Deploy Edge Functions

```bash
# Deploy the updated send-push-notification function
supabase functions deploy send-push-notification

# Deploy register-push-subscription if it exists
supabase functions deploy register-push-subscription
```

### 3. Deploy Frontend

Build and deploy your frontend with the updated code:

```bash
npm run build
# Then deploy to your hosting (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
```

## 📱 Requirements

### For iOS Push Notifications to Work:

1. **iOS Version:** 16.4 or later
2. **Browser:** Safari only
3. **PWA:** Must be installed to home screen
4. **HTTPS:** Site must be served over HTTPS
5. **Service Worker:** Must be registered (✅ Done)
6. **Permission:** User must explicitly grant permission

### Supported Platforms:

| Platform | Support | Requirements |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| iOS 16.4+ | ✅ Full | PWA installed, Safari |
| iOS < 16.4 | ❌ No | Not supported |
| Android | ✅ Full | Chrome, Edge, Samsung Internet |
| Desktop | ✅ Full | Chrome, Edge, Firefox |

## 🧪 Testing

### On iOS Device:

1. **Install PWA:**
   - Open site in Safari
   - Tap Share button
   - Select "Add to Home Screen"
   - Open app from home screen

2. **Enable Notifications:**
   - In the app, go to Settings (mobile dashboard)
   - Look for "Push Notifications" card
   - Tap "Enable Push Notifications"
   - Grant permission in iOS dialog

3. **Test Notification:**
   - Tap "Send Test Notification" button
   - Close or minimize the app
   - Check iOS Notification Center
   - You should see the test notification! 🎉

### Via Admin Dashboard:

```javascript
// Test sending notification to a driver
await supabase.functions.invoke('send-push-notification', {
  body: {
    userId: 'DRIVER_USER_ID',
    title: 'New Order Available!',
    message: 'Pickup at Restaurant - $12.50',
    data: {
      type: 'order_assignment',
      orderId: '12345'
    }
  }
});
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Architecture:

```
1. User grants notification permission
   ↓
2. Service worker subscribes to push
   ↓
3. Subscription saved to database
   ↓
4. Server sends push via Web Push API
   ↓
5. iOS receives push notification
   ↓
6. Notification appears in notification center
   ↓
7. User taps → App opens to relevant screen
```

### Flow Diagram:

```
Driver's iPhone (iOS 16.4+)
    ↓
Safari → Install PWA to Home Screen
    ↓
Open PWA → Service Worker Registers
    ↓
User taps "Enable Notifications"
    ↓
iOS Permission Dialog → User Grants
    ↓
Push Manager subscribes with VAPID key
    ↓
Subscription sent to Supabase
    ↓
Stored in push_subscriptions table
    ↓
[Order Created]
    ↓
Edge Function called
    ↓
Sends Web Push with VAPID auth
    ↓
iOS Push Service receives
    ↓
Notification appears!
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Push notifications require iOS 16.4+"
- User needs to update their iPhone to iOS 16.4 or later
- Check: Settings → General → Software Update

### "Please install the app to your home screen"
- User is browsing in Safari, not running as PWA
- Need to: Share → Add to Home Screen → Open from home screen

### "Permission denied"
- User denied notification permission
- Fix: iOS Settings → Safari → Notifications → Allow Notifications
- Then reinstall PWA

### "VAPID keys not configured"
- Edge function environment variables not set
- Follow Step 1 above to add secrets

### Notifications not appearing
1. Check service worker is registered (DevTools → Application)
2. Check subscription exists in database
3. Check Edge Function logs in Supabase Dashboard
4. Verify VAPID keys are correct
5. Test with "Send Test Notification" button

## 📝 Code Locations

### Frontend:
- **VAPID Public Key:** `src/config/environment.ts`
- **iOS Component:** `src/components/mobile/IOSPushNotifications.tsx`
- **Permission Setup:** `src/components/mobile/PushNotificationSetup.tsx`
- **Service Worker:** `public/sw.js`
- **SW Registration:** `src/main.tsx`

### Backend:
- **Edge Function:** `supabase/functions/send-push-notification/index.ts`
- **Web Push Helper:** `supabase/functions/send-push-notification/web-push-helper.ts`
- **Subscriptions Table:** `supabase/migrations/...push_subscriptions.sql`

## 🎯 Features

### What Works:

- ✅ Native iOS notifications (iOS 16.4+)
- ✅ Notifications when app is closed
- ✅ Notifications when phone is locked
- ✅ Action buttons (Open App, Dismiss)
- ✅ Notification badges
- ✅ Deep linking to specific screens
- ✅ Test notification feature
- ✅ Auto-detect iOS version
- ✅ Auto-detect PWA mode
- ✅ Permission status tracking

### Limitations:

- ❌ Custom notification sounds (uses system sound)
- ❌ Custom vibration patterns (uses default)
- ❌ Silent notifications (all must show UI)
- ⚠️ Only works in Safari (iOS restriction)
- ⚠️ Must be installed as PWA (iOS restriction)

## 🔒 Security

- VAPID keys use ES256 encryption
- Private key stored securely in Supabase secrets
- Never exposed to client
- Authenticated push prevents spoofing
- Subscriptions tied to authenticated users

## 📈 Monitoring

### Check Push Success Rate:

```sql
-- View all active subscriptions
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_subscriptions,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN device_type = 'ios' THEN 1 END) as ios_devices
FROM push_subscriptions
WHERE is_active = true;

-- View recent notifications sent
SELECT * FROM order_notifications
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Edge Function Logs:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Edge Functions → send-push-notification → Logs
3. Look for:
   - "Web Push sent successfully" ✅
   - "Web Push failed" ❌

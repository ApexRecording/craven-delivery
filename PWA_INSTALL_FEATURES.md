### Returning Visitor:

- Can always visit /download for instructions

## 📍 Key URLs

- **Install Banner**: Appears automatically on iOS (3s delay)
- **Download Page**: http://localhost:8080/download
- **Production**: https://yoursite.com/download

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Banner Timing:
```tsx
// src/components/InstallAppBanner.tsx (line ~35)
setTimeout(() => setShowBanner(true), 3000); // Change 3000 to desired ms
```

### Change Dismissal Duration:
```tsx
// src/components/InstallAppBanner.tsx (line ~29)
const sevenDaysAgo = Date.now() - (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000); // Change 7 to desired days
```

### Customize Colors:
```tsx
// Banner uses your theme colors:
bg-gradient-to-r from-orange-500 to-red-500
```

## 🚀 Production Deployment

When you deploy to production:
1. Update manifest.json with production URLs
2. Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for PWA)
3. Test on real iOS/Android devices
4. Share /download link on social media
5. Add "Install App" button in your header/menu

## 💡 Marketing Tips

### Make It Visible:
- Add "Get the App" button in header
- Link to /download in footer
- Share /download link on social media
- Email customers: "Install our app for faster ordering!"
- Banner will do the rest automatically

### Messaging:
- ✅ "Install our app" (feels like app store)
- ✅ "Add to home screen" (accurate but less appealing)
- ✅ "Get instant access" (benefit-focused)
- ❌ "Bookmark our site" (sounds boring)

## 🎉 Benefits

## 📊 Analytics Ideas

Track installs by monitoring:
```javascript
// Check if running in standalone mode
const isInstalled = window.matchMedia('(display-mode: standalone)').matches;
// Send to analytics: "User opened as PWA"
```
